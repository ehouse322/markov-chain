(acts 26 29) 2 i have changed my mind in recent months about the lost (or prodigal) son are jesus' way of giving god's response to what is happening when jesus eats with tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear we read "now the tax collectors the lovers of money or family or praise or power or sex or scholarships or friends or anything in all three dimensions of life are we growing in the vertical life of the lost coin and the servant `go out to the feast of god luke 15 1 10 i hope that you can enter this morning no matter what you have done take heed how you hear 4 when sinners respond to the truth of christ to do we are the local cuisine " 26) if any one comes to the feast of god and for the righteousness of god you ought to be praying with all your heart that god give you ears to hear 4 when sinners respond to the invitation of jesus and how he meets your needs you are the local cuisine if you get up thanksgiving morning and eat a loaf of white bread for breakfast thanksgiving dinner will not sound attractive when someone calls you with an invitation at mid morning some preferred wives to god and for the rewards of the gospel of luke especially chapters 14 and 15 i want us to see the inconsistency of this parable that the invitation of christ to do therefore we must call ourselves to account again and again in all three dimensions of life are we growing in the way luke makes the transition from chapter 14 to chapter 15 34) "salt is good but if the salt of the taste buds of your soul that causes you to hunger more for the land nor for the dunghill men throw it away he who has ears to hear we read "now the tax collectors the lovers of money and the lost sheep and the lost (or prodigal) son are jesus' way of giving god's response to what is happening when jesus eats with them '" the religious representatives of god in all three dimensions of life are we growing in the biblical depth of our worship are we growing in the poor and maimed and blind an lame beat the hedges look under the bridges god will have his banquet hall of god's invitation to the feast of god 1 when all the programs and seminars and meetings have come to see the familiar verses of chapter 15 34) "salt is good but if the salt has lost its taste how shall its saltness be restored 35) it is fit neither for the land nor for the banquet of his eternal joy is sent through the church universal what the world then every time you hear 4 when sinners respond to the banquet of the life of this event should be minimized now my thinking
